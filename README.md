# Third_Eye_Glove

The "Third Eye Glove" is a conceptual assistive device designed to enhance the sensory perception and navigation abilities of blind individuals. While such a device may not exist as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the concept could involve the following features :

SENSORS

The Glove would be equipped with a high-resolution various sensors, such as ultrasonic sensor, to detect the surroundings.

OBJECT RECOGNITION

The device would use advanced image recognition technology to identify objects, obstacles, and landmarks in the user's path.

HAPTIC FEEDBACK

The Glove would provide haptic feedback to the wearer, using vibration or pressure points on the hand, to convey information about the environment. For example, it could vibrate more intensely when an obstacle is close.

BUZZER OUTPUT

The device might also have an Buzzer Output, like bone conduction or a small speaker, to provide beep sound for the alert of the wearer person.

The goal of the Third Eye Glove is to empower blind individuals with improved spatial awareness and navigation capabilities, ultimately enhancing their independence and mobility. Keep in mind that technological advancements and the development of such devices may have occurred since my last update in September 2021..
